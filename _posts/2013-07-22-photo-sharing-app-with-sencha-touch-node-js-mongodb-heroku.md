For this presentation, I created a tiny sample application with Sencha Touch -- Photo Sharing App. This application is aim to share a photo data, data is stored into MongoDB, is deployed to Heroku cloud platform.



I thought this is maybe useful for developers who want to create Sencha Touch application which works with Node.js. So I will share the source code.
