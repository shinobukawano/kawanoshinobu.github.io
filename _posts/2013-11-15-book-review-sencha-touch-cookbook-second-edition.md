<h1>What I liked</h1>

Maybe, this book is best fit for newbies because It offers clearly overview of what Sencha Touch framework is able to do. Unfortunately, I have some of experience about this framework, so I reviewed it by veterans viewpoint.

Recipes are constructed by following section.

<ul>
<li>Getting ready</li>
<li>How to do it...</li>
<li>How it works...</li>
<li>There's more...</li>
<li>See also</li>
</ul>

Author, Ajit Kumar described practical tips rhythmically and logically. I really enjoyed to reading and learning the topics. Especially, I enjoyed "There's more" section, it has full of insight. Yeah, that's why I said my review is by veterans viewpoint. This book might be boring for veteran developer but I think "There's more" section is valuable to read if you are familiar with this framework.

For instance, I didn't know button component is able to decorate by html config, like this.

Maybe it's a tiny things, but I'm happy to know this. I assure that this book offers you tiny but useful knowledge.

<h1>What I didn't like</h1>

Sometimes, I encountered some of curiosity code. For example, define model class in launch method.. Maybe it's just for a description but it's not friendly for beginners.

<h1>Final thoughts</h1>

This book says "Every recipe is practically focused. Maximum action. Minimum theory.", yup, I really agree with it. I enjoyed reading this book with hand-on.

Sencha Inc. offers many of documentation, but sometimes I had a question about how to use this framework correctly. This book taught me a one of the answers.
